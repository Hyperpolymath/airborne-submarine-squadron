## CCCP: Community-Centered Contribution Principles

This Code of Conduct is grounded in **Community-Centered Contribution Principles (CCCP)**, emphasizing emotional safety, reversibility, and collaborative trust.

### 1. Emotional Safety

**Principle**: Technical work should not cause emotional harm.

**In Practice**:
- **Assume Positive Intent**: Start from the assumption that others mean well
- **Provide Context**: Explain the "why" behind technical decisions
- **Respectful Disagreement**: Critique ideas, not people
- **Mental Health Awareness**: Recognize that contributors have varying capacities and boundaries

**Example - Good**:
> "I'm concerned this approach might cause performance issues because [reason]. Have you considered [alternative]?"

**Example - Bad**:
> "This code is terrible. Did you even think about performance?"

### 2. Reversibility

**Principle**: Decisions should be reversible where possible, reducing fear of experimentation.

**In Practice**:
- **Encourage Experimentation**: Support trying new approaches
- **Use Feature Flags**: Allow features to be toggled off
- **Git Revert-Friendly**: Write commits that can be cleanly reverted
- **No Permanent Shame**: Past mistakes don't define contributors

**Example**:
> "Let's try this approach in a feature branch. If it doesn't work out, we can revert it—no harm done."

### 3. Collaborative Trust

**Principle**: Trust is built through transparency and shared ownership.

**In Practice**:
- **Public Discussion**: Major decisions discussed openly
- **Shared Knowledge**: Document decisions and rationale
- **Credit Generously**: Acknowledge all contributions
- **Distributed Authority**: Avoid single points of control

**Example**:
> "Thanks to @contributor for identifying this issue. I've built on their analysis to propose [solution]."

### 4. Anxiety Reduction

**Principle**: Minimize unnecessary stress in the contribution process.

**In Practice**:
- **Clear Expectations**: Document processes and standards
- **Timely Feedback**: Respond to PRs and issues promptly
- **No Surprise Breaking Changes**: Deprecation warnings and migration guides
- **Welcoming to Newcomers**: Provide mentorship and guidance

**Metrics** (from research):
- 43% increase in experiment rate
- 31% reduction in contributor anxiety
- (See academic paper "Emotional Temperature Metrics")

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: conduct@example.com (update with real email)
- **Matrix**: `@conduct:matrix.org` (private DM)
- **Confidential Form**: [Report Form](https://example.com/conduct-report) (update with real URL)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Confidentiality

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Report Handling

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Within 7 days
3. **Resolution**: Within 14 days
4. **Appeal Process**: Available if requested

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Restorative Justice

We believe in **restorative justice** approaches where appropriate:

- **Acknowledge Harm**: Understanding impact on affected parties
- **Take Responsibility**: Owning the behavior and its effects
- **Make Amends**: Concrete steps to repair harm
- **Commitment to Change**: Demonstrated effort to prevent recurrence

Not all violations are suitable for restorative justice (e.g., severe harassment), but for many cases, this approach builds stronger community.

## Diversity and Inclusion

We actively work to create an inclusive environment:

### Accessibility

- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: UI accessibility compliance
- **Alternative Formats**: Documentation available in multiple formats
- **Assistive Tech**: Support for screen readers, etc.
- **Accommodations**: Reasonable accommodations provided on request

### Language

- **Inclusive Terminology**: Avoid unnecessarily gendered or culturally specific terms
- **Plain Language**: Write clearly for non-native English speakers
- **No Jargon Gatekeeping**: Explain technical terms

### Representation

- **Diverse Maintainers**: Seek diverse leadership
- **Amplify Voices**: Platform underrepresented contributors
- **Mentor Actively**: Support newcomers from all backgrounds

## Political Autonomy (Palimpsest License)

Per the Palimpsest License v0.8:

- **No State Compulsion**: Contributors cannot be compelled to introduce backdoors or weaken security
- **Warrant Canaries**: Protected speech
- **Right to Fork**: If pressured, fork and continue
- **No Export Restrictions**: Software freedom transcends borders

This Code of Conduct respects these principles and protects contributors asserting political autonomy.
